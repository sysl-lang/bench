# Sources

The C, Rust, C++ and Swift programs come from the Computer Language Benchmarks Game source archive
(`https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/download/benchmarksgame-sourcecode.zip`,
fetched 2026-11-12), the project at https://salsa.debian.org/benchmarksgame-team/benchmarksgame.

**Licence: BSD-3-Clause**, copyright (c) 2004-2008 Brent Fulgham, 2005-2024 Isaac Gouy, as published
in the archive and reproduced in [LICENSE-benchmarksgame.md](LICENSE-benchmarksgame.md). Each file
keeps its own header naming its contributor. `programs/knucleotide/c/khash.h` is
[klib](https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib)'s `khash.h` (MIT licence, Attractive Chaos), which the
k-nucleotide C program includes. The two sysl versions of each program are written for this repo.

"Archive file" below is the file name inside that zip, under the program's directory. **Unchanged**
means the file is copied as it was, apart from the entry in the *Changes* column.

Every program is single-threaded. The reference algorithm column is the work every language, sysl
included, must do (README rule 3).

| program | reference algorithm |
|---|---|
| n-body | the pairwise advance of five bodies, then the energy |
| spectral-norm | ten rounds of A, then A transposed, applied to a vector, with A computed on the fly |
| fannkuch-redux | every permutation in lexicographic order, flipping until a 1 leads |
| binary-trees | every node a separate heap allocation, built, walked and freed |
| mandelbrot | up to 50 iterations per pixel, bits packed eight to a byte |
| fasta | the 139968-state generator, each symbol chosen by scanning the cumulative probabilities |
| k-nucleotide | every k-mer counted into a hash table keyed by its 2k-bit code |
| reverse-complement | each record read whole, complemented through a table, reversed and re-wrapped at 60 |

## Programs

| spectralnorm | C++ | `spectralnorm.gpp` | unchanged |

| binarytrees | C++ | `binarytrees.gpp-2.gpp` | unchanged |
| binarytrees | Rust | `binarytrees.rust` | the `typed_arena` crate (an arena, so not the reference allocation pattern) replaced by `Box` nodes, and the thread per depth by a loop |
| binarytrees | Swift | `binarytrees.swift` | the Dispatch queue replaced by a sequential loop |
| mandelbrot | C | `mandelbrot.gcc-8.gcc` | unchanged |

| fasta | Rust | `fasta.rust-3.rust` | unchanged |
| fasta | Swift | none | **a port of the C program above, written for this suite**: the archive's Swift programs build a `String` a `Character` at a time (`fasta.swift-8`) or use Dispatch threads (`fasta.swift-2`, `-3`), neither of which is the C program's work |
| knucleotide | C | `knucleotide.gcc` | unchanged; needs `khash.h` |
| knucleotide | C++ | `knucleotide.gpp-3.gpp` | `__gnu_pbds::cc_hash_table` replaced by `std::unordered_map` (libc++ has no pb_ds), and the `std::async` worker per core by one call |
| knucleotide | Rust | `knucleotide.rust` | the archive program keys a `HashMap` by a freshly allocated `Vec<u8>` per position, which is a different data structure from the others' integer keys. Rewritten to key a `HashMap` by the 2k-bit `u64` code with a one-multiply hasher; the reading, sorting and output are the archive's. Threads removed |
| knucleotide | Swift | `knucleotide.swift-2.swift` | `concurrentPerform` over 8 tasks replaced by a loop over one task; the Dispatch queues removed |
| revcomp | C | `revcomp.gcc-4.gcc` | unchanged |
| revcomp | C++ | `revcomp.gcc-4.gcc` | **the C program ported to C++** (casts on `malloc`/`realloc`, the table copied with `memcpy`). The archive's C++ programs (`revcomp.gpp`, `-2`, `-3`) read line by line through iostreams and ran 45 times slower than C, which is the I/O library rather than the algorithm |
| revcomp | Rust | `revcomp.rust-2.rust` | `rayon::join` replaced by a local sequential `join` |
| revcomp | Swift | `revcomp.swift` | the Dispatch reader, worker and writer queues replaced by a sequential loop |

## Implementation variants of one algorithm

Some programs differ in how the same arithmetic is laid out, as they do on the Benchmarks Game. The
Rust spectral-norm and the C++ and Rust mandelbrot carry two values in a struct or eight pixels in an
array so the optimizer can vectorize, and the Rust n-body computes all pairwise differences in arrays.
They do the same operations on the same data as C and are kept; the table's ratios below 1.00 for Rust
and C++ are mostly this. The fannkuch programs generate the permutations in the same order by different
rotation schemes (C: Ledrug's; C++: Branimir Maksimovic's; Rust: a factorial-number scheme; Swift and
sysl: Rex Kerr's count array).

## The two sysl forms

Both sysl forms use C's algorithm: the same work, the same arithmetic on the same data.

**`sysl-idiomatic`** is what a sysl programmer writes by default: the pleasant form, using whatever the
language offers for writing it pleasantly. That includes vectors (`<N>T`) where they are the natural
tool: mandelbrot computes the eight pixels of one output byte as one `<8>real`.

**`sysl-fast`** may use any documented feature that trades pleasantness for speed: vectors everywhere,
fixed-size arrays, unchecked indexing, explicit layouts, manual unrolling. It may not carry a
workaround for a compiler gap. The test is whether the change would be pointless once the compiler
does its job; if so, it is an entry in FINDINGS.md and not code. Hand-hoisting fields into locals,
calling `llvm.sqrt` by hand, hand strength reduction and keeping generator state in a local by hand
are all workarounds in this sense. Where no legitimate feature beats the idiomatic program,
`sysl-fast` is a copy of it.

What each `sysl-fast` program does differently from `sysl-idiomatic`:

- **nbody**: a body's position and velocity are `<3>real`, so a pair's distance, its squared length
  and both velocity updates are vector operations.
- **fannkuchredux**: the permutation state is three `[16]usize` arrays instead of heap slices.
- **spectralnorm**: a copy. Rust's form, two columns per step, needs the integer denominators of two
  columns as a `<2>real`, and sysl has no conversion from `<2>usize` to `<2>real` (FINDINGS.md).
- **binarytrees, mandelbrot, fasta, knucleotide, revcomp**: copies.
